# GroceriesHelper

GroceriesHelper is a simple command-line tool to help you track your grocery spending.

## How it works

1.  You enter the total amount you spent.
2.  You allocate parts of that total to different categories (e.g., "treats", "cleaning", etc.).
3.  The tool calculates the remaining amount, which is assumed to be your grocery spending.
4.  It displays a breakdown of your spending by category.

## How to run

```
python main.py
```
